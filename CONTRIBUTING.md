# Contributing to Meridian Runtime Examples

- Keep examples minimal and well-documented.
- Add a short README to each example directory with setup and run steps.
- Prefer pure-Python examples with minimal external dependencies.
- Add tests or a smoke-run step for new examples.

## Development

- Use `uv run` to execute scripts and tests.
- Run `uv run pytest -q` before submitting a PR.
- Ensure examples run on Python 3.11â€“3.13.
